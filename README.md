# Hi, I'm Vilda

I am a Computer Science Master’s graduate specializing in the intersection of Machine Learning, Statistical Programming, and Scalable AI systems. I enjoy building interpretable models and end-to-end data pipelines, with experience ranging from reinforcement learning for algorithmic trading to production-grade SAS programming for clinical study reports. My core toolkit includes Python, SAS, RL, and Full-stack cloud deployment.

## Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, SAS
- Tools & Frameworks: .NET, React, Unity, Git, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, CatBoost
- ML/AI: Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, LLM evaluation, Predictive Modeling, Model Interpretability
- Cloud/Deployment: RunPod, Cloud GPU
