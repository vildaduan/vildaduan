# Hi, I'm Vilda

I am a Computer Science Master’s graduate specializing in the intersection of Machine Learning, Statistical Programming, and Scalable AI systems. I enjoy building interpretable models and end-to-end data pipelines, with experience ranging from reinforcement learning for algorithmic trading to production-grade SAS programming for clinical study reports. My core toolkit includes Python, SAS, RL, and Full-stack cloud deployment.

## Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, SAS
- Tools & Frameworks: .NET, React, Unity, Git, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, CatBoost
- ML/AI: Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning, LLM evaluation, Predictive Modeling, Model Interpretability
- Cloud/Deployment: RunPod, Cloud GPU


## Featured Projects

### [Clinical SAS CDISC Pipeline: End-to-End Implementation](https://github.com/vildaduan/clinical-sas-cdisc-pipeline)
An end-to-end data transformation suite that bridges the gap between raw EDC data and submission-ready analysis. 
* **Core Tech:** SAS 9.4, CDISC SDTM (v3.3), ADaM (v1.1).
* **Key Achievement:** Mapped raw clinical data to SDTM DM and ADaM ADSL domains; generated validated Table 14.1 outputs using `PROC TABULATE` with precise column-wise statistical denominators.

### [Clinical SAS TLF Development](https://github.com/vildaduan/Clinical-SAS-TLF-Development) 
A programmatic suite for generating CSR-standard Demographic and Baseline Characteristics (Table 14.1). 
Features CDISC-aligned data structures, advanced reporting via `PROC REPORT`, and integrated 
statistical comparisons (Wilcoxon Rank-Sum and Fisher’s Exact tests) to evaluate treatment arm balance.

### [Machine Learning for Trading](https://github.com/vildaduan/machine-learning-for-trading)  
A Python‑based market simulator for algorithmic trading that processes historical orders, tracks portfolio performance, and visualizes strategy outcomes. Includes comparison visuals between manual vs Q‑learning strategies.

### [Sales Data Dashboard](https://github.com/vildaduan/sales-data-dashboard)  
A full‑stack dashboard displaying the top‑performing sellers by month, built with a .NET Core backend and React frontend. Includes branch filters and interactive UI for exploring sales performance.
