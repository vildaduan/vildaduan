# Hi, I'm Vilda

I’m a Master’s graduate in Computer Science with training in SAS programming and clinical-style data projects. I have experience working with simulated clinical datasets following CDISC SDTM/ADaM standards and generating Tables, Listings, and Figures (TLFs) using SAS. I enjoy building structured data pipelines and performing statistical analyses to produce reproducible, analysis-ready outputs. My toolkit includes SAS, R, and Python.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** SAS, Python, R, SQL, C#, TypeScript, JavaScript
- **Statistical Programming & Standards:** CDISC SDTM & ADaM, PROC REPORT, PROC TABULATE, PROC SGPLOT
- **Data & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Excel
- **Other Tools:** Git, Docker, .NET, React, Cloud GPU

## Featured Projects

### [Clinical SAS TLF Development](https://github.com/vildaduan/Clinical-SAS-TLF-Development) 
Programmatic suite for generating CSR-standard **Tables, Listings, and Figures**.  
- Uses CDISC-aligned data structures and **SAS reporting procedures** (`PROC REPORT`, statistical comparisons)  
- Evaluates treatment arm balance using Wilcoxon Rank-Sum and Fisher’s Exact tests  
- Demonstrates full clinical trial reporting workflow  

### [Clinical SAS CDISC Pipeline](https://github.com/vildaduan/clinical-sas-cdisc-pipeline)  
End-to-end data transformation from raw EDC data to **submission-ready analysis datasets**.  
- Implements **SAS 9.4**, CDISC SDTM (v3.3) & ADaM (v1.1)  
- Mapped raw clinical data to SDTM DM and ADaM ADSL domains  
- Generated validated Table 14.1 outputs using `PROC TABULATE` with precise statistical denominators  

### Other Technical Projects  
- **Machine Learning for Trading:** Python-based market simulator with portfolio tracking and strategy visualization  
- **Sales Data Dashboard:** Full-stack .NET Core + React dashboard showing top-performing sellers and interactive analytics
